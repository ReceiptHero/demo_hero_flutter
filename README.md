# Demo Hero Flutter

## Description
This repository contains a template Flutter project, with a JSON dump containing 800 receipts included (assets/receipts.json). Implement an application to display most important data from each receipt (price, store name, timestamp, ...) to the user. Also implement a summary of all the loaded receipts.

Loading a lot of data at once can be performance expensive. Consider tackling this issue the way you best see fit.

*Disclaimer: The application should be mobile focused.*

## Things to keep in mind
Focus on good coding practices\
Application should be extended\
Everything does not need to be polished. Prepare to explain how things should be improved in later iterations\
There is not a only one way to implement functionality\
**Have fun!**

## Technologies and how to use
At Receipthero we heavily utilize the following technologies:\
[Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_riverpod) for state management\
[Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) to enforce immutability in state\
[Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) for HTTP communications

### Usage and development
Ensure that your development environment is configured properly: ```flutter doctor``` \
Install dependencies: ```flutter pub get``` \
Start hacking: ```flutter run```
