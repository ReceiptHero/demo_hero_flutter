# Demo Hero Flutter

## Description
This repository contains a template Flutter project, with a JSON dump containing 800 receipts included. Implement an application to display most important data from each receipt (price, store name, timestamp, ...) to the user. Also implement a summary of all the loaded receipts.

Loading a lot of data at once can be performance expensive. Consider tackling this issue the way you best see fit.

## Technologies and how to use
At Receipthero we heavily utilize the following technologies:\
[Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_riverpod) for state management\
[Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) to enforce immutability in state\
[Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) for HTTP communications

### Usage and development
Ensure that your development environment is configured properly: ```flutter doctor``` \
Install dependencies: ```flutter pub get``` \
Start hacking: ```flutter run```
